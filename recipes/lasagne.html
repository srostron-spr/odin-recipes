    <h1>Lasagne</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagne.jpeg" alt="Lasagne">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne by the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce, 
        with a few tweaks inspired by locals—adjusting the meat, wine, and whether to add milk. 
        One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential. The ragù is simple, with no garlic, 
        herbs, or spices. Fresh pasta eliminates the need for pre-boiling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth, divided, more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start preparing ragù by sautéeing pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat 
            until fat renders, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook, stirring 
            until vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook while mashing 
            meat into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add wine and bring to a boil. Add 1 cup broth and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and 
            partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer ragù, stirring occasionally, 
            about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 more cup of broth to ragù. Continue simmering, stirring often, until very thick, 
            1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if necessary; ragù should drop, not run, off a spoon. 
            Set aside.</li>
        <li>Start preparing pasta after ragù is cooked. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. 
            Add spinach, cover, and return to a boil. Cook, stirring gently, until spinach is heated through. 
            Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
        <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as 
            much water as possible; reserve the liquid. Purée spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
        

    </ol>
